info2 : "For a New Nation, Hamilton Seeks a Bank Welcome to THE MAKING OF A NATION -- American history in VOA Special English. He was the top planner and policy maker under President George Washington. He was also the nation s first secretary of the Treasury. Today, Maurice Joyce and Shep O Neal continue the story of Alexander Hamilton. As we said in our last program, young Alexander Hamilton wanted to be a military commander. He hoped to demonstrate his bravery by fighting in a war. So, when the thirteen American colonies rebelled against Britain in the 1770s, he joined a militia in New York state. It was not long before Hamilton met the commander-in-chief of American forces, George Washington. General Washington invited Hamilton to become one of his assistants. One of Hamilton s jobs was to get money and supplies for the army. He asked the thirteen state governments. He also asked the Congress, which had little political power at that time. He got almost no help from either. Hamilton felt the American system of government was too weak and disorganized. He did not like democracy, rule by the people. Instead, he liked aristocracy, rule by a rich upper class. Alexander Hamilton was a proud man. He was quick to criticize others. He even criticized George Washington. Once, during the war, he was late to a meeting with the general. Washington protested. Hamilton resigned. Washington was sorry. He had a high opinion of Hamilton s abilities. That is why he was willing to forget the incident and appoint Hamilton to the new Treasury Department. The job would be difficult. The new nation had to find ways to bring in money and pay what it owed. The new Constitution said the national government was responsible for re-paying the states  wartime loans. "

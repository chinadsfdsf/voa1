info2 : "US History Series: A Supreme Court Justice Is Put on Trial in 1805 Jefferson had a very good record during his first term as president. He ended many taxes. He paid government debts. And he gained possession of the huge Louisiana Territory from France without going to war. The Federalists were sure he would win the election of 1804. Still, they were surprised by the strength of his election victory. After the election of 1804, only seven Federalists remained in the United States Senate. Only 25 remained in the House of Representatives. One of the most powerful anti-Jeffersonian judges was Samuel Chase. He was a member of the Supreme Court. Samuel Chase was from the state of Maryland. He was active in local and national politics for a long time. He had signed America s Declaration of Independence from Britain. He had served in the Continental Congresses that governed America during and after its Revolutionary War. Yet he did not agree with all parts of the United States Constitution. When the Maryland legislature voted to approve or reject the Constitution, he voted against it. Samuel Chase was not a republican: he believed that Americans should not have the same rights. For example, he believed that all citizens should not have the right to vote. He said this would lead to mob rule. He declared that great trouble would come to the government if common people had the same rights as educated people who owned property. President Jefferson heard about Chase s statement. He told a member of Congress that he was concerned. Jefferson asked:  Should this judge s attack on the ideas of our Constitution go without punishment? The public will look to Congress to take the necessary action against him.  The Senate heard testimony for a little more than three weeks. Then it voted on each of the eight charges against Justice Chase. A two-thirds vote was needed to declare him guilty. None of the charges received the necessary two-thirds vote. The impeachment had failed. Samuel Chase could not be removed from the Supreme Court. President Jefferson had hoped that Chase would be found guilty. He did not get this wish. But, after the trial, Chase no longer used the courtroom for political purposes.Aaron Burr would not be serving with Jefferson again. The Republican Party had not supported him for vice president.Aaron Burr faced a future full of questions. He had lost all political power. He owed large amounts of money. He could not return to his home in the New York area. He would face criminal charges there as a result of his duel with Alexander Hamilton. Burr had shot and killed Hamilton in the duel. What would Burr do instead? For more than a year, he had thought about a secret plan. Details are not clear, because he said different things to different people. But history experts say the plan involved an attempt to seize Mexico from Spain. Burr could not keep his plan a secret from everyone. He needed help. He worked with two men. One was Jonathan Dayton, a former United States senator. The other was James Wilkinson, military governor of the Louisiana Territory. Burr also needed money. He got some from his daughter s husband. And he got some from a man in Ohio named Harman Blennerhassett. Mr. Blennerhassett had become rich after coming to America from Ireland. History experts say Burr tried to get help from Britain, too. Burr told the British ambassador in Washington that he wanted money and ships to create a new country. It would include Mexico and several western states. The states would be split away from the Union. The British ambassador liked Burr s plan. He told Burr that he would urge his government to support it. It would take at least four months, however, for the ambassador to communicate with his government in London. Burr decided not to wait for an answer. He began his trip to the West. That will be our story next week. Thanks to manythings.org for audio and text This is a VOA product and is in the public domain "

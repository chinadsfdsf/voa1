In 1787, a group of delegates gathered for a convention in Philadelphia. Their plan was to rewrite the Articles of Confederation. Those articles created a weak union of the thirteen states. Instead of rewriting the articles, however, they spent that summer writing a completely new plan of government. On September seventeenth, after four months of often bitter debate, the delegates finally signed the new document. Now, they had to get at least nine of the thirteen states to approve it. Today, Kay Gallant and Harry Monroe tell the story of ratifying the Constitution. Delegates to the Philadelphia convention had met in secret.  They wanted to be able to debate proposals, and change their minds, without worrying about public reaction.  Now, they were free to speak openly.  Each had a copy of the new Constitution.

Arguments  for  and  against  were the same as those voiced by delegates to the convention: The Constitution would save the United States!  The Constitution would create a dictator! The leaders who supported the new Constitution understood quickly that to win ratification, they must speak out.  So, just a few weeks after the document was signed, they began writing statements supporting the proposed Constitution. Their statements appeared first in newspapers in New York.

info2 : "US History Series: Jefferson Is Elected President in 1800, But Only on the 36th Vote  Download MP3   (Right-click or option-click the link.) Welcome to THE MAKING OF A NATION -- an American history series in VOA Special English. The presidential election of 1800 is our subject this week. The candidates included President John Adams of the Federalist Party and Vice President Thomas Jefferson of the Republican Party. Here with our story are Frank Oliver and Shep O Neal. As president, John Adams was head of the Federalist Party. But the power of that position belonged, in fact, to former treasury secretary Alexander Hamilton. Under the electoral system of that time, the candidate with the most votes became president. The candidate with the second highest number of votes became vice president. The Republican Party leader in New York was a lawyer, Aaron Burr. Burr had served as an officer under General George Washington during America s war for independence from Britain. After the war, he joined the Federalist Party and was elected to the United States Senate. Later, he changed parties and became a Republican. In 1800, a group of both Federalists and Republicans supported him as a candidate for president.  Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton were bitter enemies. When Hamilton learned of a plan by his own party to elect Burr president, instead of Jefferson, his reaction was quick and sharp.  Anybody,  he said,  even Thomas Jefferson, is better than Aaron Burr. Jefferson is not dangerous. Burr is. Jefferson s ideas of government are wrong. But at least he is an honest man. Burr is a man without honesty and character. He will destroy America.  On February eleventh, the House of Representatives began to count votes, state by state. Eight states chose Jefferson. Six chose Burr. The representatives of two states -- Maryland and Vermont -- gave each man an equal number of votes. There was no majority within those states. So neither man won the votes of those states. The voting continued. All that day and throughout the night the representatives voted. Twenty-seven times the count remained the same. Eight states for Jefferson. Six for Burr. Two undecided. The next morning, the representatives decided to rest for four hours. The voting began again at noon. There was no change. The thirteenth of February passed, then the fourteenth and fifteenth. Still no change. The House voted thirty-three times. It could not elect a president. A change in the vote of just one congressman from Maryland or Vermont could decide the contest. Later, after the election, the representative from Delaware said he had met with two congressmen from Maryland and one from Vermont. All were Federalists. All had voted for Aaron Burr. The Delaware congressman said they claimed they spoke with a friend of Thomas Jefferson. He said they told Jefferson s friend they would change their votes, if Jefferson made certain promises. Jefferson denied that he had made any political promises. He said many men tried to get promises from him. But he said he told them all that he would never become president with his hands tied. History experts do not agree on what really happened. What is sure is that the House of Representatives voted for the thirty-sixth time on February seventeenth. Ten states, including Maryland and Vermont, voted for Thomas Jefferson. Four states voted for Aaron Burr. Two states -- Delaware and South Carolina -- did not vote. But Jefferson had the majority he needed. He would be the new president. Our program was written by Harold Braverman and Christine Johnson. The narrators were Frank Oliver and Shep O Neal.

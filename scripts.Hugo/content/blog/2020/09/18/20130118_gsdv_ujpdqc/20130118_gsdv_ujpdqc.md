info2 : "From Revolutionary War Hero to President  Welcome to THE MAKING OF A NATION -- American history in VOA Special English. The United States declared its independence from Britain on July fourth, 1776. The new nation was a loosely formed alliance governed under the Articles of Confederation. All this changed when a new plan of government, the Constitution, went into effect on March fourth, 1789. There was much to be done to make it work. The machinery of government was untested. Strong leadership was needed. Today, Harry Monroe and Kay Gallant tell the story of America s first president, George Washington. Many historians believe there would never have been a United States without George Washington. He led the American people to victory in their war for independence from Britain. He kept the new nation united in the dangerous first years of its life. Washington had a strange power over the American people. His name still does. During his lifetime, he was honored for his courage and wisdom. After his death in 1799, he became almost god-like. People forgot that he was human, that he had faults and made mistakes. For well over one hundred years, Americans found it difficult to criticize George Washington. He represented the spirit of America -- what was best about the country. Recent historians have painted a more realistic picture of Washington. They write about his weaknesses, as well as his strengths. But this has not reduced his greatness and importance in the making of the nation. The force of Washington s personality, and his influence, was extremely important at the Philadelphia convention that wrote the new Constitution. Had he not agreed to attend, some say, the convention would not have been held. Later, as the first president, he gave the new nation a good start in life. Washington was able to control political disputes among officials of the new government. He would not let such disputes damage the nation s unity. Washington often thought of the future. He wanted the first government to take the right steps.

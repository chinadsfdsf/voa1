info2 : "Emancipation Proclamation Exhibit 01/04/2013   This week, the United States marked the 150th anniversary of the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation. The document freed slaves in the southern states that were fighting to secede --- to separate from the United States. President Abraham Lincoln signed the document on Jan. 1, 1863.   The federal government held a public exhibition of the Emancipation Proclamation this week in Washington. Christopher Cruise tells about the rare showing.   The National Archives put the proclamation on display for just a few days. It is a rare copy because it is signed by President Lincoln, and because it has the presidential seal, although the years have destroyed much of the seal.   While it did not immediately free slaves in all of the United States, the Proclamation did lead to the approval of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution. That measure ended slavery in the United States. The fight over the 13th amendment is the subject of director Steven Spielberg s current movie  Lincoln.     Reginald Washington is an expert in African-American documents at the National Archives. He says the document changed the debate about why the Civil War was being fought.    The proclamation, however, did bring about a fundamental change in the character of the war. With a stroke of Lincoln s pen, a war to preserve the union had overnight become a war for human liberation. For the nearly 4,000,000 slaves held in bondage, it was a symbol of hope. It gave confirmation to their beliefs and insistence that the war should be -- and was for them -- a war to secure their freedom.     Mr. Washington says many historians and scholars believe the Emancipation Proclamation is one of the greatest documents in human freedom. He says some historians believe it is as important in American history at the Declaration of Independence.   The National Archives has produced a free e-book on the Emancipation Proclamation. The one hundred fifty year old document was not well cared-for in the past. To protect it from further damage, officials permit its display for only 30 hours a year. However, the National Archives is considering the proclamation s display in other parts of the country this year to celebrate its anniversary. http://learningenglish.voanews.com/content/article/1577454.html "

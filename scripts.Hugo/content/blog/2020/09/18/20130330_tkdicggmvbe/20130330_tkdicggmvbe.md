info2 : "Welcome to THE MAKING OF A NATION-- an American history series in VOA Special English. In 1801, the United States had a new President, Thomas Jefferson. It also had a new party in power: his Democratic-Republican Party. Though supporters of Jefferson were called Republicans, that party led to the modern Democratic Party. Thomas Jefferson, third President of the United States, thus held out the hand of friendship to the Federalists. But Alexander Hamilton did not accept it. As Jefferson became President, Hamilton made a speech attacking Jefferson. For the War Department, Jefferson turned to General Henry Dearborn of New England. Jefferson s first choice to be secretary of the Navy was Judge Robert Livingston, the great lawyer from New York. But Judge Livingston rejected this position. Jefferson finally chose Robert Smith of Baltimore, Maryland. The President had already appointed one man from New England to his cabinet, Secretary of War Dearborn. Yet, he went to New England for two more appointments. Jefferson knew that the strength of the Federalist Party was greater in New England than in any other part of the country. He believed that there was no better way to move New England away from the Federalist program than to give cabinet positions to men from New England. And so, Jefferson found his attorney general in Levi Lincoln of Massachusetts. Like Dearborn, Lincoln was a patriot of the American Revolution. He had been a supporter of Jefferson from the beginning. He was famous as a lawyer in Massachusetts, where he was the top leader of the Republican Party. Jefferson went to New England, too, for the postmaster general. It was not yet a cabinet office. But its importance was growing. The President gave this appointment to Gideon Granger-- lawyer, businessman, and writer, one of the strong Jeffersonians in the state of Connecticut. Such was Jefferson s cabinet. All strong Republicans. All completely loyal. The Federalists were shocked. Not one of their men had been appointed.  Hamilton had decided to continue fighting the democratic movement in the United States. This did not worry Jefferson. He was sure he could show even the Federalists that his program was good for all. Of course, he said, the top leaders of the Federalists-- men like Hamilton-- could never be changed. But he was more interested in bringing their followers to his side. For secretary of the treasury, Jefferson chose Albert Gallatin of Pennsylvania, the brilliant leader of the Republicans in Congress, the man who understood economics and finance as well as Alexander Hamilton.

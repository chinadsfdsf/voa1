info2 : "This is Rich Kleinfeldt. And this is Sarah Long with THE MAKING OF A NATION, a VOA Special English program about the history of the United States. Today, we complete the story of the American Revolution against Britain in the late seventeen seventies. It is December, 1776.  British General William Howe has decided to stop fighting during the cold winter months. The general is in New York.  He has already established control of a few areas near the city, including Trenton and Princeton in New Jersey. General George Washington and the Continental Army are on the other side of the Delaware River.  The Americans are cold and hungry.  They have few weapons.  Washington knows that if Howe attacks, the British will be able to go all the way to Philadelphia.  They will then control two of America s most important cities.  He decides to attack. His plan is for three groups of troops to cross the Delaware River separately.  All three will join together at Trenton.  Then they will attack Princeton and New Brunswick.  Washington wants to surprise the enemy early in the morning the day after the Christmas holiday, December twenty-sixth. On Christmas night, 2,400 hundred soldiers of the Continental Army get into small boats.  They cross the partly-frozen Delaware River.  The crossing takes longer than Washington thought it would.  The troops are four hours late. They will not be able to surprise the enemy at sunrise. Yet, after marching to Trenton, Washington s troops do surprise the Hessian mercenaries who are in position there.  The enemy soldiers run into buildings to get away.  The Americans use cannons to blow up the buildings.  Soon, the enemy surrenders. Washington s army has captured Trenton.  A few days later, he marches his captured prisoners through the streets of the city of Philadelphia. Washington s victory at Trenton changed the way Americans felt about the war.  Before the battle, the rebels had been defeated in New York.  They were beginning to lose faith in their commander.  Now that faith returned.  Congress increased Washington s powers, making it possible for the fight for independence to continue. Another result of the victory at Trenton was that more men decided to join the army.  It now had ten thousand soldiers. This new Continental Army, however, lost battles during the summer to General Howe s forces near the Chesapeake Bay.  And in August, 1777, General Howe captured Philadelphia. Following these losses, Washington led the army to the nearby area called Valley Forge.  They would stay there for the winter. His army was suffering.  Half the men had no shoes, clothes, or blankets.  They were almost starving.  They built houses out of logs, but the winter was very cold and they almost froze.  Many suffered from diseases such as smallpox and typhus.  Some died. General Washington and other officers were able to get food from the surrounding area to help most of the men survive the winter. By the spring of 1778, they were ready to fight again. General Howe was still in Philadelphia.  History experts say it is difficult to understand this British military leader.  At times, he was a good commander and a brave man.  At other times, he stayed in the safety of the cities, instead of leading his men to fight.  General Howe was not involved in the next series of important battles of the American Revolution, however.  The lead part now went to General John Burgoyne.  His plan was to capture the Hudson River Valley in New York State and separate New England from the other colonies.  This, the British believed, would make it easy to capture the other colonies. The plan did not succeed. "

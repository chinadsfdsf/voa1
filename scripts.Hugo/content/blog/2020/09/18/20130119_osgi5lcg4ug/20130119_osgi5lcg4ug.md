info2 : "Welcome to THE MAKING OF A NATION -- American history in VOA Special English. Today we begin the story of Alexander Hamilton, one of the nation s most important early policy makers. The first government of the United States was weak.  It had many debts and an empty treasury. Its support from the people was not firm. There was some question about its future. Many wondered if it would last. In a few years, however, there was a change. This change was produced in large part by the energy and imagination of one man, Alexander Hamilton. Hamilton wanted to make the United States a strong and important nation. He wanted it to become the equal of the powerful nations of Europe.  Here are Shirley Griffith and Frank Oliver with our story. Alexander Hamilton firmly believed that no country could become a modern nation without industry. So, he carefully developed a program that would make the United States an industrial nation. He also organized the nation s finances.  This was done by establishing government credit and a national bank. The bank increased the flow of money needed for investment. It fed the needs of business and commercial activity. The need for money had brought much of this activity to a stop. Finally, Hamilton took steps to protect American manufacturers from foreign competition. He did this by establishing a system of import taxes -- tariffs -- on some foreign goods brought into American ports. These import taxes forced foreign manufacturers to raise their prices. As a result, American manufacturers had much less competition in selling their products. Such a tariff system, Hamilton hoped, would strengthen American industry. He thought the United States should not have to depend on other nations for the things it needed. Such a system, he believed, would create a demand for all kinds of workers. It would increase immigration from other countries. And it would bring a new and greater demand for American farm products. Hamilton s financial program helped manufacturers. But it did not seem to do much for farmers. There was a loud protest, especially among farmers in the south. Everything he did, they said, helped the industrial and banking interests of the north. Yet the farmers had to pay more for the manufactured goods they needed. At the same time, they had to sell their crops at lower prices. Hamilton succeeded in getting Congress to approve his financial proposals. Yet his political victories brought him many enemies. And they started a Constitutional debate that continued throughout American history. The dispute involved this question: What exact powers do the government and the Congress have under the Constitution? Alexander Hamilton believed the Constitution gave the government a number of powers besides those written down  Source: The Imagination of Alexander Hamilton TEXT = http://www.voanews.com/specialenglish/archive/2008-04/2008-04-09-voa1.cfm?renderforprint=1 MP3 = http://www.voanews.com/mediaassets/specialenglish/2008_04/Audio/mp3/se-nation-hamilton.mp3 "

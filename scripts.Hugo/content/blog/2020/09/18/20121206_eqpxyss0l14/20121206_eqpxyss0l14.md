info2 : "American History: Westward Expansion Brings Explorers, Settlers in Contact with the Plains Indians 09/27/2012 Welcome to THE MAKING OF A NATION -- American history in VOA Special English. I m Steve Ember.  This week in our series, we look at the history of early American Indians. The native peoples of North and South America came from Siberia thousands of years ago. There was a land bridge between Siberia and Alaska before the end of the last ice age. As the groups settled different parts of the land, they developed their own cultures and religions.  Each group s story is important in the history of the Americas. But our story today will focus on the tribes in what became the central part of the United States.    In eighteen four, Merriwether Lewis and William Clark led a group of explorers to the Pacific Ocean. They met the tribes of the Great Plains. The explorers were perhaps the first white people these Native Americans had ever seen.  When the group of explorers neared the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains, they encountered the Shoshone tribe. Merriwether Lewis was the first to see them. Imagine for a moment that we are with Merriwether Lewis near the Rocky Mountains. Across a small hill, a group of sixty Shoshone men are riding toward us.  The first thing we see is that these men are ready for war. Each is armed with a bow and arrow. Some carry long poles with a sharp knife on the end.  They are riding very fast. Some of the horses look like they do not have riders. But as they get closer we see that the riders are hanging off the sides of the horses, or under the neck. They are using the horses  bodies for protection.  The horses are painted with many different designs in blue, black, red and other colors. Later we learn that each design has a special meaning for the man who owns the horse.  Each one tells a story. http://learningenglish.voanews.com/content/native-american-indians-plains-westward-expansion-catlin-lakota-shoshone-sioux/1516073.html "

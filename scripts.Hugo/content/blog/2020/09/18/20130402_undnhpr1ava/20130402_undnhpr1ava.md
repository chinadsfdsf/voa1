info2 : "THE MAKING OF A NATION-- American history in VOA Special English. In our last program, we talked about two proposals by President Thomas Jefferson. Congress approved both of them. One proposal ended some taxes. The other reduced the number of judges appointed by John Adams when he was president. So, Marshall said, the 1789 law permits Marbury to take his case directly to the Supreme Court.  But the Constitution does not.  The Constitution, he added, is the first law of the land.  Therefore, the congressional law is unconstitutional and has no power. Chief Justice Marshall succeeded in doing all he hoped to do.  He made clear that Marbury had a right to his judicial commission. He also saved himself from a battle with the administration.  Most importantly, he claimed for the Supreme Court the power to rule on laws passed by Congress. President Jefferson understood the importance of Marshall s decision.  He did not agree with it.  He waited for the Supreme Court to use this new power. Several times during Jefferson s presidency, Federalists claimed that laws passed by the Republican Congress violated the Constitution.  But they never asked the Supreme Court to reject those laws. During Jefferson s first term, the United States faced a serious problem in its relations with France. France had signed a secret treaty with Spain.  The treaty gave France control of a large area in North America --  the Louisiana Territory. Napoleon Bonaparte ruled France at that time.  Jefferson did not want him in North America.  He felt the French presence was a threat to the peace of the United States.  He decided to try to buy parts of Louisiana. Jefferson sent James Monroe to Paris as a special negotiator. Napoleon had decided to sell everything to the Americans.  He told his finance minister to give up Louisiana --  all of it. Napoleon needed money for a war with Britain. James Monroe was happy to negotiate the purchase of Louisiana. They agreed on a price of eighty million francs for all the land drained by the great Mississippi River and all its many streams. After the election, Burr asked Hamilton to admit or deny the comments he had made against Burr.  Hamilton refused.  The two men exchanged more notes.  Burr was not satisfied with Hamilton s answers.  He believed Hamilton had attacked his honor.  Burr demanded a duel. A duel is a fight, usually with guns.  In those days, a duel was how a gentleman defended his honor.  Hamilton opposed duels.  His son had been killed in a duel.  Yet he agreed to fight Burr on July eleventh, 1804. The two men met at Weehawken, New Jersey, just across the Hudson River from New York City.  They would fight by the water s edge, at the bottom of a high rock wall. The guns were loaded.  Burr and Hamilton took their places.  One of Hamilton s friends explained the rules.   Are you ready, gentlemen?  he asked.  Both answered  yes.   There was a moment of silence.  He gave the signal.  Burr and Hamilton raised their guns.  Two shots split the air. Hamilton raised up on his toes, then fell to the ground.  Burr remained standing.  He looked at Hamilton with regret, then left. Hamilton died the next day.

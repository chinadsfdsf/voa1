info2 : "Welcome to THE MAKING OF A NATION -- American history in VOA Special English. This week in our series, Steve Ember and Shirley Griffith have the story of Thomas Jefferson s final acts as president, and the election of James Madison. In the closing days of 1807, President Thomas Jefferson signed a bill banning all trade with Europe. No ships could enter the United States, and no ships could leave. The purpose of the trade ban was to keep America out of the war between Britain and France. Jefferson acted to protect American traders, ship owners and sailors. Yet those were the people who protested loudest against the ban. They were willing to take the chance of having Britain or France seize their ship and goods. They could make no money without trade. President Jefferson did not believe that trade bans -- embargoes -- were the best way to settle America s problems with other nations. But at the time, he thought an embargo was the only way to deal with Britain and France, short of war. And he did not want war. Jefferson hoped that the loss of American trade would force Britain and France to change their policies toward the United States. And he hoped the change would come quickly, for he knew the American people would not accept a long ban on trade. America s northern industrial states felt the loss of trade most strongly. But the agricultural South also was affected. Rich southern farmers and planters suddenly found themselves poor. Opposition was strongest in the Northeast. Ship owners and traders there believed that the embargo was wrong. They continued to export goods secretly. Some traders began sending goods over land to Canada. From there, the goods were sent on to Britain. Congress passed a law against this kind of trade. But the shipments did not stop. Too many people were willing to violate the law for the large amounts of money they could make by trading secretly with Britain. By August, 1808, Treasury Secretary Albert Gallatin had lost all hope that the embargo would be successful. Gallatin told President Jefferson:  The embargo is now defeated by open violations, by ships sailing without permission of any kind.  Thomas Jefferson had served two four-year terms as president. No law prevented him from running again. But Jefferson had decided years before that a man should be limited to two terms as president. Madison was elected. As we said earlier, Congress was trying to resolve the issue of the embargo before Jefferson left office. In the first months of 1809, it finally approved a bill. The bill lifted the ban on trade with all European countries except Britain and France. Jefferson had hoped to continue the embargo a little longer and with more powers to enforce it. He was not satisfied with the final bill. But he signed it anyway on March first. Three days later, the 15-month-old embargo was dead. And the United States had a new president. thanks to manythings.org for audio and text this is a VOA product and is in the public domain "

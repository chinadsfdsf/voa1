info2 : "12/26/2012 From VOA Learning English, welcome to THE MAKING OF A NATION -- American history in Special English. I m Steve Ember. This week in our series, we continue the story of the United States Constitution.  In May of 1787, a group of America s early leaders met in the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They planned to amend the Articles of Confederation. That document established a loose union of the 13 states. Instead, they wrote a completely new constitution. It created America s system of government and recognized the rights of its citizens.  That Constitution, with other amendments added over the years, is still the law of the land.  The delegates agreed to start the convention as soon as seven states were represented. On May 25th, they finally began. They gathered in the same room where America s Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776.  The first important decision was choosing a president for the convention. Several of the delegates urged the others to choose George Washington. Washington was the most famous man in America. He had led the forces that won the war for independence from Britain. The delegates agreed. Washington was their choice.  George Washington officially opened the convention with a short speech. He thanked the delegates for naming him president of the convention. But he said the honor was too great. He asked the delegates to forgive him if he made mistakes. After all, he said, he had never been chairman of a meeting before.  With those words, George Washington sat down. Here are two actors playing George Washington and James Madison. They discuss Washington s role in writing the Constitution.   WASHINGTON:  As for that document, I merely stood back and let the learned gentlemen do their work. I believe I spoke only once in convention, and that to a minor point.     MADISON:  I believe you do yourself an injustice, sir. As president of the convention, you led the way.   Washington did lead the way, but it was not a straight path. From the beginning, the delegates agreed that they had the right to change their decisions. This was the rule. The convention did not just discuss a proposal, vote on it, and move on to other issues. Any delegate could ask to again discuss any proposal or any decision. And they often did. The same speeches that were made the first time were made again. So days, even weeks, passed between discussions of the same proposal.  The delegates also agreed on a rule of secrecy. Guards were placed at the doors of the State House. Newspaper reporters were not allowed inside. And the delegates were not allowed to discuss convention business in public.  The secrecy rule led people to think all kinds of things about the convention. This was true especially in Europe. There, most people believed the convention was discussing how America could be ruled by a king. Europeans said a republican government worked in a small country, such as Switzerland. But it would not work, they said, in a land as large as America. http://learningenglish.voanews.com/content/article/1572485.html "

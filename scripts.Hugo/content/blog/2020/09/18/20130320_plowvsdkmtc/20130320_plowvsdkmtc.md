info2 : "John Adams Is Elected Nation s Second President Welcome to THE MAKING OF A NATION -- American history in VOA Special English. The year 1796 saw a change in American politics. That year, the new nation held its third presidential election. And for the first time, there was more than one candidate. George Washington won the first two elections without opposition. But now there were two political parties. The Federalists were led by former Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton. The Republicans were led by former Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson. This week in our series, Harry Monroe and Kay Gallant tell the story of the election of 1796 and the winner, John Adams. Historians still cannot explain why John Adams -- a man who did not like or trust Alexander Hamilton -- kept the three cabinet secretaries. If the secretaries had been men of great ability, then that might be an explanation. But they were not. As we said earlier, John Adams was a great man and a true patriot. He was born in the village of Braintree, Massachusetts, in 1735. He wanted to be a farmer. But he was sent to Harvard College to study to be a clergyman. He had no interest in this life and became a lawyer, instead. Not many people really liked this difficult, aristocratic man. Strangely enough, one of the few who did was Thomas Jefferson. This was strange, because Jefferson s political philosophy was opposed to everything Adams represented. Adams did not expect the job to be easy. He once wrote:  In politics, a man must always walk on broken glass and red-hot iron. It is not easy to do this when you are not wearing shoes. But some men must do it. There are many dangerous things that have to be done for our country in these dangerous times. If nobody else will do them, I will.  "

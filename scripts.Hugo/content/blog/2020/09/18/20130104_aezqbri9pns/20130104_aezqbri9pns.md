info2 : "12/12/2012 From VOA Learning English, this is THE MAKING OF A NATION -- American history in Special English. I m Steve Ember.   The United States became a nation in 1776. Less than a century later, in the 1860s, it was nearly torn apart. A civil war took place, the only one in the nation s history. States from the North and the South fought against each other. The conflict involved the right of the South to leave the Union and deal with issues -- especially the issue of slavery -- its own way.   This week in our series, we examine how the Constitution survived this very troubled time in American history.   The Civil War was fought from 1861 to 1865. Six hundred thousand men were killed or wounded. In the end, the slaves were freed, and the Union was saved.   Abraham Lincoln was president during the Civil War. He said the southern states did not have the right to leave the Union. Lincoln firmly believed that the Union was permanent under the Constitution. In fact, he noted that one of the reasons for establishing the Constitution was to form a more perfect Union. His main goal was to save what the Constitution had created.   One cannot truly understand the United States without understanding its Constitution. The document describes America s system of government and guarantees the rights of its citizens. The power of the Constitution is greater than any president, court or legislature.   In the coming weeks, we will tell the story of the United States Constitution, including the drama of its birth in Philadelphia in 1787. Before we do, however, we want to look at how the document provides for change without changing the basic system of government.   If you ask Americans about their Constitution, probably the first thing they will talk about is the Bill of Rights. These are the first ten changes to the Constitution. These ten amendments have the most direct effect on people s lives.   The Bill of Rights guarantees freedom of speech, freedom of religion and freedom of the press. In fact, all of those and more, including the right to peaceful assembly, are contained just in the first amendment. The second one states,  A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.  The fourth amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. Other amendments say that people in criminal cases cannot be forced to make statements against themselves, and have a right to a speedy and public trial by a jury.   The Bill of Rights also deals with the separation of powers between the federal government and the states. In the words of the tenth amendment:  The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.  In other words, powers belong to the states unless the Constitution gives them to the federal government or prevents the states from having them.   The Bill of Rights was not part of the document signed at the convention in Philadelphia in 1787. The delegates believed that political freedoms were basic human rights. Some of the delegates thought it was unnecessary to express these rights in a Constitution.   Most Americans, however, wanted their rights guaranteed in writing. This is why most states approved the new Constitution only on the condition that a Bill of Rights would be added. This was done, and the amendments became law in 1791.   One early amendment involved the method of choosing a president and vice president. In America s first presidential elections, whoever received the most votes became president. The candidate who received the second highest number of votes became vice president.   The Constitution was changed after separate political parties developed. Then, ballots began to list the names of separate candidates for president and vice president.   There were no other amendments for 60 years.   The next one was born in the blood of the civil war. During the war, President Lincoln announced the Emancipation Proclamation. That document freed the slaves in the states that were rebelling against the Union. Later, the thirteenth amendment banned slavery everywhere in the country. But Lincoln never lived to see it; he was shot a week after the South surrendered.    The Fourteenth Amendment, approved in 1868, said no state could limit the rights of any citizen. And the Fifteenth, approved two years later, said a person s right to vote could not be denied because of his race, color, or former condition of slavery.     http://learningenglish.voanews.com/content/constitution-bill-of-rights/1563863.html  http://www.voanews.com/MediaAssets2/learningenglish/2012_12/N-015_Transition_to_Constitution_MASTER_12-11-12.Mp3 "

info2 : "11/15/2012 American History: The Shot Heard Around the World From VOA Learning English, this is THE MAKING OF A NATION -- American history in Special English. I m Steve Ember.   This week in our series, we look at the start of the American Revolution.   The road to revolution in the late seventeen hundreds took several years. There were protests against the British policy of taxing the colonies without giving them representation in Parliament.   To prevent trouble, the British sent thousands of soldiers to Boston, the largest city in Massachusetts.    Jayne Gordon, the director of education and public programs at the Massachusetts Historical Society, explains the mood at the time.    We re looking at a time of great tension, we re looking at a time when there s an expectation, I think, on both sides that something will happen but nobody knows exactly what or when.    On March fifth, seventeen seventy, that tension led to violence.   It was the end of winter but the weather was still very cold.  A small group of colonists began throwing rocks and pieces of ice at soldiers guarding a public building. They were joined by others, and the soldiers became frightened. They fired their guns.   Five colonists were killed. The shooting became known as the Boston Massacre.   The people of Massachusetts were extremely angry. The soldiers were tried in court for murder. Most of them were found innocent. The others received minor punishments.   Fearing more violence, the British Parliament removed most of the taxes on the colonists. Only the tax on tea remained.   The tensions eased for a while. Imports of British goods increased.  The colonists seemed satisfied with the situation, until a few years later. Then the Massachusetts colony once again became involved in a dispute with Great Britain.   The trouble started because the government wanted to help the British East India Company. That company organized all the trade between India and other countries in the British empire.   By seventeen seventy-three, the company had become weak. The British government decided to let the company sell tea directly to the American colonies. The colonies would still have to pay a tea tax.   The Americans did not like this new plan. They felt they were being forced to buy their tea from only one company.   Officials in the colonies of Pennsylvania and New York sent ships from the East India Company back to Britain. In Massachusetts, the British governor wanted to collect the tea tax and enforce the law. When the ships arrived in Boston, some colonists tried to block their way.  The ships remained just outside the harbor without unloading their goods.   On the night of December sixteenth, seventeen seventy-three, a group of colonists went out in a small boat. They got on a British ship and threw all the tea into the water.   Destroying the tea was a serious crime.    The colonists were dressed as American Indians so the British would not recognize them. But the people of Boston knew who they were. A crowd gathered to cheer them. That incident -- the night when British tea was thrown into Boston harbor -- became known as the Boston Tea Party.    And all of a sudden, with the Tea Party, they say enough is enough.  http://learningenglish.voanews.com/articleprintview/1546407.html "

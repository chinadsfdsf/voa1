info2 : "11/28/2012 STEVE EMBER: From VOA Learning English, this is THE MAKING OF A NATION -- American history in Special English. I m Steve Ember.    This week in our series, we continue our story of the American Revolution.    On July fourth, seventeen seventy-six, the Second Continental Congress, meeting in Philadelphia, approved the Declaration of Independence. The new country, the United States of America, was at war with its former colonial ruler, Britain. Yet not everyone in the former colonies agreed with the decision to declare independence.    No one knows for sure how many Americans remained loyal to Great Britain. John Adams, the Massachusetts political leader, thought that about a third of the colonists supported independence, a third supported Britain and a third supported neither side.    Today many historians think that only about twenty percent of the colonists supported Britain. Some colonists supported whichever side seemed to be winning.    As many as thirty thousand Americans fought for the British during the war. Others helped Britain by reporting the movements of American troops.    Who supported Britain? These groups included people who were appointed to their jobs by the king. They also included leaders of the Anglican Church and people with business connections to the British.    Professor Gordon Wood at Brown University in Rhode Island says many colonists from minority groups remained loyal to the king.     One of the problems of the American revolution that emerged very quickly was the tyranny of the majority, which the founders, revolutionary leaders, had not anticipated. But I think we re seeing the problems that emerge when you overthrow an authoritarian leader, and you re going to have a relatively democratic society. Then the protecting the minority becomes a problem.     Other people remained loyal because they did not want change or because they believed that independence would not improve their lives. Some thought the actions of the British government were not bad enough to bring about a rebellion. Others did not believe that the rebels could win a war against a nation as powerful as Britain.    American Indians disagreed among themselves about the revolution. Congress knew it had to make peace with the Indians as soon as the war started. If not, American troops might have to fight them and the British at the same time. To prevent trouble, American officials tried to stop settlers from moving onto Indian lands.    In some places, the Indians joined the Americans, but generally they supported the British. They expected the British to win. They saw the war as a chance to force the Americans to leave their lands. At times, the Indians fought on the side of the British, but left when the British seemed to be losing the battle.    The Americans did not forget that the Indians chose to fight for the British. When the war was over, the Americans felt they owed the Indians nothing.    African slaves in the colonies were also divided about which side to join during the American Revolution.    Thousands of slaves fought for the British. The British offered them freedom if they served in the army or navy.    Some American states also offered to free slaves who served, and hundreds of free blacks fought on the American side. Many slaves, however, felt their chances for freedom were better with the British. http://learningenglish.voanews.com/content/revolution-john-adams-slaves-tories-saratoga-patriots/1554933.html "

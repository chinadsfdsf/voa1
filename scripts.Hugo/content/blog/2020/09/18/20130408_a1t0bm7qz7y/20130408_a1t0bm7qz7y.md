info2 : "This week in our series, Steve Ember and Shirley Griffith continue the story of Thomas Jefferson s second term as president. In the early 1800s, Britain and France were at war with each other. The United States remained neutral. President Jefferson did not want to become involved in a war. He believed it would destroy all the progress he had made. His economic policies had helped to pay much of the national debt. And he was able to reduce taxes. Staying neutral was not easy, however. The United States was having trouble with Britain. For many years, Britain had been taking men by force to serve in its navy. The custom was called  impressment.  Britain claimed the right to impress -- or seize -- any British citizen, anywhere. Britain wanted to stop the United States from trading with France and its colonies. British warships blocked the port of New York all through the year 1805. No American ship could leave without being searched. When goods for France were discovered, the ship was taken to Halifax on the coast of Canada. There, a British court had the power to seize the goods and force the ship s owners to pay a large amount of money. President Jefferson protested this interference in American trade The House of Representatives debated the two proposals. After four months, it finally approved a ban on the import of some British goods. President Jefferson did not want the trade ban to last long. He pressed for an agreement with Britain. He sent William Pinkney to assist James Monroe in London. At the end of December, 1806, Monroe and Pinkney sent word to Washington that the treaty was ready. But from the way their note was written, it seemed the treaty might not be satisfactory. Secretary of State James Madison wrote back. He said if the two diplomats could get no clear agreement on the question of impressment, then the talks should end without a treaty. But it was too late. Monroe and Pinkney had signed the agreement. President Jefferson was angry. His negotiators had disobeyed his orders. He refused to send the treaty to the Senate for approval. And he said he would tell Monroe and Pinkney to re-open negotiations. Before that could happen, an incident added more fuel to the diplomatic fire. A British navy ship attacked the American Navy ship Chesapeake while looking for deserters.President Jefferson ordered all British navy ships in American waters to leave at once. He told citizens not to aid them. And he said any person -- American or British -- who disobeyed his orders would be arrested. In London, James Monroe protested the attack on the Chesapeake. But the British foreign minister did not want to talk about the incident. Monroe saw little purpose in remaining. So he sailed for home. A few days after he left London, the British government announced a new rule. It said any American ship sailing to Europe must stop first in Britain to get permission. Ships violating the rule would be seized. Relations between the two countries had reached the breaking point. The president sent a special message to Congress. He proposed that no ships be permitted to enter the United States, and no ships be permitted to leave. Both houses of Congress approved Jefferson s proposal. He signed the measure in the closing days of 1807. Jefferson later explained why he thought the embargo was the best choice of action. He said if American ships had sailed out of American waters, they would have been seized by Britain or France. That would have forced the United States into war. Jefferson    It was far better to stop all communications with these nations until they returned to some sense of justice.  Jefferson s decision, and continuing tense relations with Britain, caused problems through his final days as president. The situation did not improve for America s next president, James Madison.  thanks to manythings.org for audio and text this is a VOA product and is in the public domain "
